/* This program is written to perform specific tasks given below;


	1 - Given a distance in meters and the speed of a car in km/h, 
		calculate how many seconds it will take for that car to travel
		that distance +++ 


	2 - A car traveling down a road approaches an intersection and slows
		down from a high speed to a lower speed in a certain time. Calculate the car's constant rate of acceleration, using the
		following formula. +++

			(Note: You should decide which values must be given as input to solve this problem.)

			acceleration = (Vfinal - Vinitial) / time


	3 - The cost to the consumer of a new car is the sum of the wholesale
		cost of the car, the dealer's markup for 12 percent and a sales tax of 6 percent, calculate the consumer's cost given the wholesale
		cost of the car he buys. +++


	4 - A real estate agency pays its sales staff a salary of 400 Dollars
		per month plus a commission of 50 Dollars for each piece of real estate
		they sell plus 1 percent of the value of the sale. Compute and display
		a salesperson's salary given the number and the total value of sales
		he made in that month. +++


	5 - Given a three digit integer, display each of its digits as individual 
		numbers like 357 -- 3 5 7 +++


	6 - Given a distance in meters, display it in meters, centimeters and 
		milimeters. +++

			34.468 meter == 34 Meters 46 Centimeters 8 Milimeters


	7 - Given a time duration in minutes, display this time duration in days, hours
		and minutes. 

			if the given duration is 3550 min. Display it as 

				2 days, 11 hours, 10 min
