/*
		1 - Given a temperature in degrees Centigrade (C), convert it into
			degrees Fahrenheit (F)

		2 - Given a temperature in degrees Kelvin (K), convert it into degrees
			Rankine (R)

					( K = 273 + C, R = 512 + F)

		3 - Calculate the are and the perimeter of a circler, given its
			diameter.

				(pi = 3.1416)

				Area of a circle = pi * r^2
				Perimeter of a circle = 2 * pi * radius

		4 - Calculate the volume and the surface are of a cylinder, using the
			following formulas. (Note: You should decide which values must be 
			given as input to solve this problem)


				Volume = pi * radius^2 * height
				Surface Area = (2 * pi * radius^2) + (2 * pi * radius * height)
