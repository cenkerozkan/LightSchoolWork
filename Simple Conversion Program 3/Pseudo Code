This program has been written to perform
the specific tasks mentioned below:

	1 - Take a quantity given in TL and find the VAT (KDV)
		for this amount if VAT rate is 8%

	2 - Given the cost of an item in TL, display the amount of
		VAT you have to pay for it, and the cost of the item with
		VAT, if percentage of the VAT for that item is 12%

	3 - Given the marks a student got from Midterm 1, Midterm 2
		and final exam of a course, calculate the average grade
		of that student

	4 - Solve the previous problem again, but this time calculate
		the wighted average grade of that student, so that, Midterm 1
		forms 25%, Midterm 2 forms %30, and the final exam forms %45 of
		his grade.
